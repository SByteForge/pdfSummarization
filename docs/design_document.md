# PDF Summarizer Design Document

#### 1. **Project Overview**
The **PDF Summarizer** is an application that reads PDF documents and generates concise summaries using Large Language Models (LLMs). The application is built using **LangChain** for language processing and **Streamlit** for creating a user-friendly web interface. It allows users to upload PDF files, which are processed for text extraction and then summarized using an LLM.

#### 2. **Key Features**
- **PDF Reading**: Extracts text from PDF files for further processing.
- **Summarization**: Leverages LLMs, such as OpenAI models, to generate summaries of extracted text.
- **Interactive UI**: A web-based interface built using Streamlit, allowing users to upload PDFs and view summaries in real-time.

#### 3. **Architecture Design**
The application follows a modular structure, ensuring that the components for PDF extraction, summarization, and the UI are decoupled for scalability and maintainability. The main architectural components include:

- **Frontend (Streamlit)**: Provides the user interface, allowing users to upload PDFs and view summaries.
- **Backend (LangChain & LLM)**: Handles the PDF text extraction and LLM-based summarization.
- **Storage**: Stores uploaded PDFs and their summaries temporarily for processing.

#### 4. **Technologies Used**
- **Python 3.8+**: Core language for the project.
- **LangChain**: Framework for building applications with LLMs.
- **Streamlit**: Library for building interactive web applications.
- **pdfplumber**: Tool for extracting text from PDF documents.
- **OpenAI API**: LLM integration for summarization tasks.

#### 5. **Detailed Component Design**
1. **PDF Reader**:
   - Uses `pdfplumber` to extract text from uploaded PDFs.
   - Handles multi-page PDF documents.
   - Processes the raw text for input into the summarization model.

2. **Summarization Component**:
   - Integrates with LangChain for managing the pipeline of text processing.
   - The core summarization logic communicates with OpenAI API, sending extracted text and receiving summarized output.
   - Supports configurable summarization parameters like length, detail level, etc.

3. **Interactive UI**:
   - Built using Streamlit for easy-to-use, real-time interaction.
   - Allows users to upload PDFs and displays summaries in a clean, simple interface.
   - Handles file uploads and calls backend components to process the PDF and return summaries.

#### 6. **Project Structure**
- **data/**: Stores raw and processed PDF files.
- **docs/**: Documentation for the project.
- **src/**: Source code for the PDF reader, summarization logic, and Streamlit app.
  - **pdf_reader.py**: Handles PDF text extraction.
  - **summarizer.py**: Interacts with LangChain and OpenAI API for summarization.
  - **streamlit_app.py**: Hosts the Streamlit web app.
- **tests/**: Contains unit and integration tests.
- **.env**: Contains environment variables like the OpenAI API key.

#### 7. **Installation & Setup**
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pdf-summarizer.git
   cd pdf-summarizer
   ```
2. **Set up the Virtual Environment**:
   - Create a virtual environment (optional):
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - For macOS/Linux:
       ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```
     - For Windows:
       ```bash
       venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:
     ```
     OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
     ```

#### 8. **Usage**
To start the application:
1. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run src/streamlit_app.py
   ```
2. Open the browser, upload your PDF files, and view the generated summaries.

#### 9. **Testing**
- The project includes unit tests for individual components and integration tests for end-to-end functionality.
- To run the tests:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```

#### 10. **Future Enhancements**
- **Additional File Formats**: Support for DOCX, TXT, and other file formats.
- **Customization**: Allow users to customize summarization parameters (e.g., summary length, detail level).
- **Export Options**: Enable users to download the summary as a text file or PDF.
- **Caching**: Cache processed summaries to avoid repeated LLM calls for the same document.

#### 11. **Contributions**
- Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests.
