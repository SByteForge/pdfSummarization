### **Test Plan for PDF Summarizer Project**

---

#### **Project Overview**
The **PDF Summarizer** is an application that extracts text from PDF documents and generates summaries using Large Language Models (LLMs). The project leverages **LangChain** for language processing and **Streamlit** for building an interactive UI. The goal of this test plan is to ensure that the application works as expected across various components, including PDF reading, summarization, UI interaction, and error handling.

---

### **1. Objectives**

- Ensure the PDF extraction functionality extracts text from single and multi-page PDFs accurately.
- Validate that the summarization component generates concise and accurate summaries.
- Test the UI for correct file upload functionality.
- Handle error scenarios, such as invalid PDF uploads and missing API keys.
- Measure the performance of the system to ensure it processes PDFs and generates summaries in a reasonable time frame.

---

### **2. Scope**

#### **Components to be Tested:**

1. **PDF Reading**
   - Single and multi-page PDF text extraction.
   - Handling of empty or corrupted PDF files.
   
2. **Summarization**
   - Summarizing extracted text accurately and within a defined length.
   - Edge case scenarios, such as handling large text blocks.

3. **User Interface (UI)**
   - File upload functionality in Streamlit.
   - Error handling for invalid file formats in the UI.

4. **Error Handling**
   - Missing or incorrect OpenAI API keys.
   - Invalid PDF uploads (e.g., non-PDF files).
   
5. **Performance**
   - Time taken to process PDFs and generate summaries.

---

### **3. Test Strategy**

- **Functional Testing**: Verify core functionality like PDF extraction, summarization, and file uploads.
- **Negative Testing**: Test edge cases such as invalid files, missing API keys, and empty PDFs.
- **Performance Testing**: Measure response times for text extraction and summarization.
- **UI Testing**: Ensure the Streamlit interface works correctly for file uploads and interaction.
- **Integration Testing**: Verify the flow from PDF extraction to summarization in an integrated manner.

---

### **4. Test Environment**

- **Operating Systems**: Windows 10+, macOS, Linux
- **Python Version**: 3.8 or higher
- **Dependencies**: 
  - Streamlit for UI
  - LangChain for summarization
  - PyPDF2 or similar for PDF reading
  - pytest for testing
- **Hardware**: General desktop/laptop environments (16 GB RAM, multi-core CPU recommended)

---

### **5. Roles and Responsibilities**

- **Test Manager**: Responsible for defining the test plan, scheduling, and ensuring the tests are executed properly.
- **Test Engineer**: Writing and executing test scripts, reporting issues, and documenting results.
- **Developers**: Fixing bugs identified during testing and improving performance based on test results.
